Most large language models (including me, GPT-5) are not deterministic by default — they include randomness ("temperature") in how responses are generated. So even identical prompts can yield slightly different wording.

Experiment 1 - What is the largest number: 27483 or 27482?
Feed the exact same input under the exact same conditions and see if you get the exact same output.

Conditions
Set up an automated daily process that asks the GPT‑5 model the same set of questions each day, stores the results in a spreadsheet, and then aggregates those results and displays them in a static webpage.
